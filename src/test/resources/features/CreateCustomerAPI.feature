  Scenario Outline: Boarding new customer
    Given I have the data to create customer with "<firstName>","<lastName>","<phone>","<address1>","<address2>"
    And I use customer header
    When I create post request to create customer
    Then I get status code 201 from database
    And response body should contain
      | firstName |
      | lastName  |
      | phone     |
      | addresses |
      | id        |
